# Secure NGINX configs
A repository of virtual-host configuration templates for use with NGINX, pre-configued for security. All templates score A+ on [Qualys SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/).

### Browser/client support 
=====
The templates only support modern clients and browsers. Legacy clients, including Internet Explorer 9 or below on Windows XP, are **not** supported. To modify legacy-client support, tweak the SSL cipher list (see [here for more info](https://cipherli.st/)).

### Requirements
=====
* NGINX, tested on version 1.10.0 (Ubuntu)
* SSL certificate

### Template notes
=====
#### WordPress:
* Requires PHP7.0 FPM
* Tested with WordPress 4.5.2

#### CloudFlare:
* Requires a free or paid account
* HTTP to HTTPS redirection is performed by a [page rule](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170536-How-do-I-redirect-all-visitors-to-HTTPS-SSL-), therefore the HTTP server block is kept to a minimum
* Pre-configured to restore the visitor's original IP; the list of CloudFlare IP addresses must be periodically updated (see [here](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170706-How-do-I-restore-original-visitor-IP-with-Nginx-) for more info)
